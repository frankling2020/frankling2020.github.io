  ## Simple Summarizer

  It contains a React-based summarizer built with ChatGPT whose primary purpose of the application is to generate a summary of paragraphs with highlighting of the relevant keywords. It aims to facilitate the comprehension of the original text and to enhance user trust in the generated summary. I also make efforts in protecting the personally identifiable information (PII) with Presidio.

  **Tools**: *Docker, OpenAI, Presidio, ReactJS, Flask (gunicorn + gevent), Celery (Redis + MongoDB), Nginx, JMeter*
